# Copilot Instructions

- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript style guide for React/JSX code.
- Treat this repository's `.eslintrc.js` as the source of truth when rules differ from Airbnb defaults.
- Keep JSX clean and readable with standard Airbnb formatting and spacing.
- Use Airbnb/default ESLint quote style unless `.eslintrc.js` explicitly overrides it.
- Ensure proposed changes pass ESLint for the files being modified.
