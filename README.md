# Folke sÃ¶k GUI (aka PublikUtforska-GUI)
Public crowdsource map based interface

[Accessibility](Accessibility.md)

## Code style and conventions

* Use [ES6](http://es6-features.org/) syntax.
* Use [React](https://reactjs.org/) [functional components](https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component) with [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) rather than class components. When making changes to an existing class component, consider [refactoring it to a functional component](https://react.dev/reference/react/Component#alternatives). Make use of [generative AI tools](https://chat.openai.com/share/1574d01c-0b6e-43e3-82a4-a0de8d5ac955) to help you with the refactoring.
* Use [PropTypes](https://reactjs.org/docs/typechecking-with-proptypes.html) to document the props of a component.
* Use [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

## Development with Visual Studio Code

Recommended extensions:

* Code style: We use [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) to enforce a consistent code style. The rules are defined in [.eslintrc.js](.eslintrc.js) and are based on [Airbnb's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). With ESLint you 
get code style warnings and errors while you type. You can run "Fix all auto-fixable Problems" (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) to fix most of the code style issues
* (optional) [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode): with Prettier you can run "Format Document" (`Shift+Alt+F`) to format the code

## Start watching code with webpack

```bash
npm run start
```

or in PowerShell:

```PowerShell
npm run start
```

## Bundle code for deployment with webpack, commit and push (make sure you know what you are doing)

Enter the correct path to the ES-API in config.js (frigg-test or frigg). Otherwise it must be done on the server afterwards. Then run:

```bash
npm run build && git add www && git commit -m 'fresh compile' && git push origin master
```

or in PowerShell:

```PowerShell
npm run build; git add www; git commit -m 'fresh compile'; git push origin master
```

Deploy code on server:

frigg-test:

```bash
cd /var/www/react/PublikUtforska-GUI/ && ./gitupdate.sh
```

frigg:

```bash
cd /var/www/react/PublikUtforska-GUI/www && ./svn_www_update.sh
```

## Upgrade node modules

Bash script to upgrade all node modules:

```bash
npm outdated; npm install $(npm outdated | egrep '^[a-z0-9@/-]*' -o | tr '\r\n' ' ') && npm outdated
```

PowerShell script to upgrade all node modules:

```PowerShell
npm outdated; npm install $(npm outdated | Select-String -Pattern '^[a-z@/-]*' -AllMatches -CaseSensitive | % { $_.Matches } | % { $_.Value } | Out-String -Width 1000000 | ForEach-Object { $_ -replace "`r`n", " " } | % {$_.TrimStart()}); npm outdated
```

## Import new data

See README.md in TradarkAdmin: https://vcs.its.uu.se/isof-devs/TradarkAdmin/src/master/README.md

## Set up ssh by following github instructions

### Example:

# Documentation

## css 
Uses less. Every component states its main css in a comment 
Example:
// Main CSS: ui-components/audio-player.less

## Components
Types:
- scripts\components\collections
- scripts\components\views
- scripts\components\

## Routing

### Use cases

* **State**: The entire state of the application (with some exceptions such as the display of overlays) is controlled by the route: E.g. search parameters, type of search, display of a single record. Enables working browser navigation.
* **Link sharing**:
    * Users can share links to found records, persons, places or search requests.
    * Sharable links from within application must work. (`records/record_id`).
    * Maybe in the future: Add sharable links for places (`places/place_id`) and persons (`person/person_id`)

Some examples:

`/places/recordtype/one_accession_row`

=> search for places (=display the map), filtered by record type 'One Accession row' without further search parameters

`/places/search/troll/category/trad3/recordtype/one_record`

=> search for places (=display the map) filtered by record type 'One record', filtered by category 'trad3' and the search term 'troll'.

`/records/ifgh00707_195393/recordtype/one_accession_row/has_media/true`

=> show record 'ifgh00707_195393' while the search is still set to parameters *recordtype=one_accesion_row* and *has_media=true*.

In app.js, we specify which route patterns can be matched:

```javascript
// app.js
<Route 
    path={['/places/:place_id([0-9]+)?', '/records/:record_id', '/persons/:person_id']}
```

In each component, the *routeHelper* (see routeHelper.js) can derive the search parameters from the route (which is accessible in `props.match.url`), so that the search parameters are available inside the component with `this.props.searchParams`.

Example:

```javascript
// SearchBox.js
// derive search params from the current route and send them to <CategoryList/> as props:
<CategoryList
    searchParams={routeHelper.createParamsFromSearchRoute(props.location.pathname.split(props.match.url)[1])}
	/>
```

Since, in the above example, the searchParams are a part of the component's **props**, changes will be passed down, i.e. changing them will also trigger (if necessary) a change in the component. This means that changes in the route (by clicking or directly changing the address line) can directly affect all components.

### What is not controlled by the routes?

Some states of the application are not in the scope of the routing. This affects all events that are triggered by eventBus, especially popups, overlays and `resize` events.
